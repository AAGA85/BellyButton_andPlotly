# PLOTLY & BELLY BUTTON BIODIVERSITY 
# From Bacteria to Beef

Roza is a biological researcher in a prominet microbiology laboratoy. She is interested in bacterial species that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her laboratory is working with an food startup called Improbable Beef, in order to find those species that will provide the perfect taste. Roza has a hypothesis that there is a microorganism that can supply the next best best taste, a bacteria that comes from the human body. She thinks that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef, may be found in the belly button. To test this hypothesis, Roza sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize belly buttons. 

In order to show the results, we have developed a interactive dashboard where the user will be able to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer:

- Horizontal Bar Chart: Top 10 bacterial species (OTUs)
- Bubble Chart: Bacterial Cultures Per Sample
- Gauge Chart: Washing Frequency
